# Variable assignment and initialization

**Quiz**

1. What is the difference between initialization and assignment?
   
   Initialization is the creation of a variable, while assignment is updating the value of variables.

   > Initialization gives a variable an initial value at the point when it is created. Assignment gives a variable a value at some point after the variable is created.

2. What form of initialization should you be using?

   Generally, the list initialization is recommended, since it forces type the value to be explicitly the same as the variable.

   > Direct list initialization.
