# Programs and Notes for Learning C++

This repository includes the programs and notes as I learn C++ at [LearnCpp](https://www.learncpp.com/).

**Note**

- I've systematically learned C++ years ago and this is an ''refresh'' of my knowledge to C++, which means, sometimes in my notes, there would be terms, abbreviations, etc. that involve some background coding knowledge.

- I'm not a native English speaker. Though I would do my best to avoid the grammar/spelling errors, there might still be unclear statements.

**Choice of Compiler**

Although [LearnCpp](https://www.learncpp.com/) recommends beginners to use IDE like Visual Studio and Xcode. But I use Visual Studio Code (VS Code) along with the C++ extension to program. As for compiling, since the programs in our learning won't be very complex I directly use GCC to compile programs manually. And I would document the compiling commands in the notes of each sections.

VS Code + GCC + Markdown is seamlessly cross-platform for me to work across Linux, MacOS and Windows (with WSL) computers.
